					You don't know the rules to <em>Tic-Tac-Toe</em>? Have you been living under a rock? Look, it's simple:
				</h3>
				<p>
					<strong>X</strong> and <strong>O</strong> players alternate. In each turn, the current player selects a cell from a 3x3 grid in which to place his or her mark (<strong>X</strong> or <strong>O</strong>). The selection is made with the number keys:
				</p>
				<table id="example">
					<tr>
						<td>1</td>
						<td>2</td>
						<td>3</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>4</td>
						<td>5</td>
						<td>6</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>7</td>
						<td>8</td>
						<td>9</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				<p>
					The game ends when one player completes three cells across, three cells down, or three cells diagonally. If the board is filled without any of these conditions being satisfied, the game is a tie.
